What is Deadline?

Deadline is an end point that you don't want to get to, but you can't stop running to, and the road to the end is littered with promises. It gives you a sense of urgency, a sense of anxiety, a sense of having to count how many promises you have left to fulfill before you get to the finish line, and helps you overcome procrastination and burnout. What is productivity? Productivity is the force that drives promise fulfillment. The number of promises fulfilled is not evenly distributed over each leg of the journey, and in most cases the closer you get to the finish line, the greater the number of fulfillments.

What are some of the circumstances that can cause the number of realizations to skyrocket?

-   Adding large amounts of manpower
-   Introduction of more advanced equipment or technology
-   deadline looming on the horizon

In actual project development, the number of project members is already set at the beginning of development, and the development technology is not going to make a qualitative leap in a short period of time, so it seems that deadline is really the first productivity. Delays are the last thing anyone wants to see, and no matter the reason given, they can lead to guilt and self-doubt at some point.

Investing time in planning and thinking and being efficient are two paths in themselves, each applicable to different scenarios. Productivity does seem to dominate when the technical solution is mature and does not require much innovation or change; when the technology is still in the development stage and early ideas have not yet been realized, the level of technological research and development cannot yet be quantified in terms of efficiency, and the natural growth of creativity should not be limited by deadline.

Does productivity apply to software development? Software development is a relatively mature field, and although it is not completely free of design and planning, it is becoming more and more assembly-line oriented, and deadline is becoming the dominant driving force. On the other hand, if most of a job requires little space for thinking and creativity, there seems to be nothing to complain about being driven by deadlines in the workplace.

If the software development industry, which you first started to work in with enthusiasm, has become a workshop, is it time to try to switch to a new field?
